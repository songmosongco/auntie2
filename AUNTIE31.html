			<b><h1> Open when I'm tampo frfr ðŸ˜¡
 </h1> </b>
			hi babyyy so im currently making tampo fr huhhh first of all u take a deep breath first and breathe. were going to be okay nati dont worry at all. were both going to try to make it work at any cost for sure. best believe its killing me too to make tampo at u for real so its probably a serious matter ok? if im not replying at the moment i might jus be taking a breather too para di kita malabasan ng masasamang words :) im sure i wld never want to do u like that. jus remember that were going to be okay, its just another obstacle that we'll get thru rin cos we both want to! as long as gusto natin at walang ibang circumstance kaya yan. please be patient lang with me nati, probs feeling all the feels rn so be patient lang for me to simmer down. ill say it first na rin before tampo me does, im sorry too if i hurt u while making tampo baby. know that i wld never intentionally do that to u and probably got too caught up w what i was feeling at that time so pls try to understand. remember that i love u soooo much even when im nagtatampo nati. we'll be okay dont worry nati ko

<br>
love,<br>

p.s.
baby if it does reach a point na ayaw mo na ayusin, pls say it agad okay? prolonging that will js make it worse for both of us cause i cant do it alone. it'll hurt more if u dont tell me okay baby? better to use that time for smthn else if di na gusto. i love uuu
