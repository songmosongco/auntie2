	<div class="div1">HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY NATI ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥this is very overdue but at least meron! 

first of all im hoping that you already got the rest of the website and that you've gone through it na. a lot of what im going to say will be seen din in the other parts but who tf cares hehehe this'll be a new year/birthday letter pala hehe. i hope you liked the website too :) 
<br><br>
tw warning: this is gna be sooo unstructured
<br><br>
so baby a year ago today I wld not have thot that I wld even reconnect w you let alone become ur sashi but ayunn He heard my prayers, saw my tears and led me to you. for mooonths I told myself that I shldnt be seeing you in another way and that you're my best friend only, nothing else, but who wldve foken known na you cld be both. it genuinely felt so wrong to like you cos I already had my chance nung gr8 and blew it so why shld I be given another one? I also knew how bad the trauma was from our past so I thot you cld never allow yourself to go through that again. but what can I say I rizzed you up too well üòé but for real, I'm so lucky you took the chance after all those happenings cause I had no hope whatsoever. 
<br><br>
you've twisted and turned my 2023 in ways I never expected and yet am thankful for cause then I wouldn't have been this happy. I cant even begin to explain how happy you make me üò≠ its inexplainable man. everytime I'm with you my mind goes blank but in a good way cos that used to be a problem for me. I literally cldnt turn off my brain if my life depended on it cause of acads or overthinking or overanalyzing or anything I cld possibly worry abt and all you had to do was exist or be to make it all go away. thats why I find it a good thing that you do make my mind go blank because for the first time in my life it didn't feel the need to overwork. you never gave it a reason to, never made it doubt you or second guess my own actions around you. I guess thats one of the reasons why I cld always find a way to get to u at the end of the week. genuinely think that the reason why I was able to angat my grades nung 2nd qtr was cos we met up more üò≠ eyo may first na ko sayo! so baby thats one of the ways I can describe how happy you make me
<br><br>
anyw so for putting my mind at ease, I'd like to say thank you sooooooo much. thank you for never giving me a reason to overthink or in short, thank you for reassuring me in any possible way you can think of. the way you reassure me makes me much more open to you and hesitate less nati. thank you for always understanding everything in my life. may it be ust, friends, family, or lack of yapping, you always find a way to compromise for it. thank you for all your huggies n kissies that I will always craveee (could never get sick of them). thank you for always keeping up with me even if I cant look you in the eye, I'm working on it I swear :) thank you for being another inspiration for me w your sipagness and your independency, but sana matuto tayong dalawa na maging less independent pag sa isat isa. thank you for being soooo patient with me, that it took me years to wake up. thank you for being my bestfriend AND nati all at once. thank you for encouraging me to become a better person everyday. your fear of the Lord, generosity, and kind heart have kept me and my values in tact. you truly deserve everything this world could give you. lastly, thank you for taking that chance nung bday ni pia cause like I said, I was readying myself for one of us to ghost the other. I was readying myself to detach from you and I dont think I'd be this happy if I did.
<br><br>
since this is a new yearrr, your 17th year and 2024, I promise to always show you just how much I appreciate and love you in ways you won't even imagine. I promise to always be by you as we go through new schools, new people, and new environments. it'll be very tough no doubt but I want you to know that in this year of change, I'll be your constant throughout okay? may there be a change in your mood, something with family, or school, I want you to know that you can run to me anytime. I genuinely hate that I make you feel that you can't express your opinions to me ab certain stuff so I promise to be less mapride (?) idk the right term, let's js say less know it all. I promise to be less of that and be more open to your thoughts. I don't think I'm always right naman but maybe I jus don't show it properly and need to change smthn with me, so I'll work on it don't worry. 
<br><br>
SO NATI KO! HAPPY HAPY HAPY BIRTHDAY BABYYYYY THIS IS ALL I GOT FOR NOW COS I CANT GET OUT OF THE HOUSE :(( U DESERVE EVERYTHING NATI. I CLD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY NATI ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
