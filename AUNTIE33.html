 </h1> </b>
			

first of all I wld already like to say sorry for making you feel this way nati I hate making you feel this way yk that. so like I said before, if you don't feel like I do anymore remember that I walked katipunan for you and now you can look at my 170 reasons! I mean every single reason I placed there, and it only took me like less than 3hrs to make that. I could go on and on with that list if I had the time. so please don't doubt the amount of love I have for you cause it's literally exponential. you make me the happiest I can be, how cld I not love you for that? And I wld love to return that to you. you know I'd do anything and everything for u js ask me okay baby? if smthn is bothering you just tell me please, I'll always find a way to understand. I love you so much nati ko ❤️ feel better soon please
